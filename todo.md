The internal and external Cloud Hosting Solutions (CHS) Tableau Servers are deployed in the Cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
The servers live in the CHS virtual data center (VDC), which allows users to connect to and explore their data in a trusted and secure environment.
Users are not responsible for installing or maintaining the server architecture on the CHS Tableau Server.
